**Title:**
Bellabeat Case Study: Optimizing User Health Through Smart Insights
**Objective:**
Identify trends in how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices, identify trends in physilogical signals and apply insights to make smart recommendations and improve Bellabeatâ€™s marketing strategy.

**Description**
I have further extended the work done by Macarena Lacasa by analysing the "heart rate" variation of users throughout the weekdays and across a 24-hour cycle.
We also developed a positbve correlation between the "heart rate & total steps taken" and negative correlation between " heart rate & total minutes slept".
The insights from the analysis can be used by the bellabeat company to deliver timed recommendations (lifestyle changes or relaxation exercises)
to the users to maintain a healthy heart rate.
(The deatiled analysis and code can be found in the R script file attached.)
